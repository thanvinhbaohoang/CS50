# Lab 4 
 

#### Delivery (20%)
 
#### Documentation & Testing (22%)
  * (-4) No README.md
  * (-2) Lacking detail in IMPLEMENTATION.md
 *  (-2) No documented assumptions
 
#### Code Quality (20%)
  * Comments are a bit much, commenting every block makes the code hard to read. Instead comment code that is not self explanitory.
  * Code style is inconsistent, for example, positioning of `=` and `==` varies in the code.
  * (-2) Code does not check if malloc's are successful
  * (-1) page saving functionality should be placed in `pagedir.c`

#### Functionality (38%)
  * Code passes test cases
